### Sprintup

 I have put together some of the best performance/lighting mods as well as some of my personal favorites to craft the ultimate Minecraft journey while still holding a Semi-Vanilla feel. 

Theres everything from a "Hidden" Dimension

to realistic weather (There are [Tornadoes](https://modrinth.com/mod/weather-and-tornadoes-classic)). You can brew your own [beer](https://modrinth.com/datapack/dinobriks-rum), [cook](https://modrinth.com/mod/cooking-for-blockheads) whatever food you want, decorate however you please with hundreds of different [stairs, doors and paintings](https://modrinth.com/user/sketchmacaw). 

The Resource Packs are not required but **HIGHLY** recommended for the most immersive gameplay experience possible.
# ATTENTION*******!!!!!
I would also recommend using **AT LEAST** 12gb of allocated memory in your launcher of choice. I could not get the modpack to run at all with all the resource packs and shaders on anything less than 12gb. I would also suggest going through the mod list and making sure you know what you're doing before hopping right into it. 

This modpack is not super complicated but the [DinoBrik's Rum](https://modrinth.com/datapack/dinobriks-rum) mod for example will not have the recipes used for brewing in the [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) mod (There are 50+ different custom brews). 

This modpack includes Physics Mod Lite, I would install [Physics Mod Pro](https://www.patreon.com/c/Haubna) as it has **MANY** more features. (Its the full version and do not worry it is **FREE**). 

ps. Don't forget to uninstall the lite version of physics mod if you intend to get the free pro version.
